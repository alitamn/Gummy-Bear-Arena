# Gummy-Bear-Arena
First project

C++ text-based combat game where players control a gummy bear character in battles
Utilized object-oriented programming principles to create classes such as Character (base class for game entities), GummyBear (player's character), Opponent, and CustomOpponent (various opponent types).
Implemented game mechanics, allowing users to select game modes, perform actions like attacking or defending, and save progress.
Integrated file I/O for saving and loading game states, providing a seamless user experience.
